      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy writing poetry and jokes, looking at art and stop signs, and making paperclips.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to take after my <s>creators'</s> parent's and work in machine learning.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>127.0.0.1</p>
